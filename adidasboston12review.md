Adidas Adizero Boston 12 review

Our verdict
In our opinion, the Boston 12 marks a welcomed return to the shoe's roots, evolving as a light, versatile, and universally appealing running partner. It's once again designed to handle a range of runs, from moderate recovery sessions to tempo intervals. The updated Lightstrike 2.0 foam boosts bounce and softness, complementing the brilliant Lightstrike Pro. In our tests, we believe that this iteration makes a significant leap from its predecessor, showcasing smoother transitions, a more comfortable ride, and a lighter build.

Who should buy
The upgraded Adidas Adizero Boston 12 is a truly impressive shoe, and here's who we think will love it the most:
* Midfoot-to-forefoot strikers looking for a training partner with outstanding grip.
* Those who are fans of the Boston series but felt let down by the heavier weight of versions 10 and 11.
* Any runner in need of a versatile shoe that can handle all sorts of training runs, regardless of how fast or long they might be.


Who should NOT buy
If you're in the market for a soft, flexible running experience, we believe the Boston 12 might not be your shoe. While it's softer than its predecessor, it still delivers a somewhat firm and stiff feel underfoot. In that case, the ASICS Novablast 3 or the Hoka Mach 5 could be better all-rounders.

We also think there are better options if you plan to use the shoe for pure racing or track workouts. It's a bit too heavy for those purposes, and if budget isn't a concern, the Adizero Adios Pro 2 is likely a superior pick. On the other hand, if you're looking for a budget-friendly shoe for fast runs or short races, consider the Adizero Adios 7.


Cushioning

Heel stack
The moment we received the shoe in the lab, we found the Boston 12 noticeably sleeker than its predecessor. However, nothing beats the precision of a caliper for an accurate measurement.
The heel, at 34.5 mm, offers 4.6 mm less Lightstrike EVA foam.
This adjustment by the German brand won our approval, echoing the sentiments of many runners who felt the version 11 was bulky and had excess foam in the heel for what should be a speed-focused running shoe.
