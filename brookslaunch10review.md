Brooks Launch 10 review

Our verdict
The Brooks Launch 10 stands out as a light, fun daily trainer at a reasonable price of only $110. Equipped with a well-cushioned midsole and a durable outsole, we believe it's capable of handling almost every pace. Although there's room to enhance breathability and the foam can become too firm in cold temperatures, we think these minor setbacks don't overshadow the incredible value of this versatile running shoe.

Who should buy
We are of the opinion that this Brooks daily trainer is a great choice for:
* Those seeking a value-oriented running shoe that can handle almost any pace and distance
* Beginners who want a versatile road running shoe without breaking the bank
* Runners looking for a lightweight workhorse to add to their collection.


Who should NOT buy
We're not going to lie—this Brooks shoe is so good that it's hard to find a runner who shouldn't get them. But there are two potential situations where you may want to explore other alternatives.

If you like low-drop or even mid-drop shoes, this one is going to be too steep for you with its 10-mm heel-to-toe drop. You might want to check the Hoka Mach 5 instead.

Also, if you live in a cold climate and you're not on a budget, there are better choices in the market. A versatile and light shoe with premium foam like the Saucony Endorphin Speed 3 is a wiser choice in this scenario.

Cushioning

Heel stack
You might be thinking—if it's that light, it probably has a low stack height. But that's not the case at all!

We measured the stack height in the heel at 33.8 mm, and that's more than enough cushion even for heel strikers.
